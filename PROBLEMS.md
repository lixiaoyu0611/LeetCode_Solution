## 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two <br>numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br>
You may assume that each input would have exactly one <br>solution, and you may not use the same element twice.<br>
###Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,<br>
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,<br>
return [0, 1].<br>

## 2. Add Two Numbers 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.<br>
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.<br>
###Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)<br>
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8<br>
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.<br>
###Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"<br>
Output: 3 <br>
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.<br> 
###Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.<br>
###Example 3:
Input: "pwwkew"<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.<br> 
             Note that the answer must be a substring,<br> "pwke" is a subsequence a  <br>

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.<br>
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).<br>
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.<br>
###Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]<br>
nums2 = [2]<br>
The median is 2.0<br>
###Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]<br>
nums2 = [3, 4]<br>
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5<br>

## 15. 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.<br>
Note:<br>
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.<br>
###Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],<br>
A solution set is:<br>
[<br>
  [-1, 0, 1],<br>
  [-1, -1, 2]<br>
]<br>

## 16. 3Sum Closest
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target,<br> find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.<br> Return the sum of the three integers.<br> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.<br>
###Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.<br>
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).<br>
