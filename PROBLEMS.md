## 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
###Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

## 2. Add Two Numbers 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
###Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
###Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
###Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
###Example 3:
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence a

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
###Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0
###Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

## 15. 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
###Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

## 16. 3Sum Closest
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
###Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
